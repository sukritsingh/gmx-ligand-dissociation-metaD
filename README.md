Input files for setup and running metadynamics simulations for ligand dissociation

These are input files for running a sample simulation for running metadynamics for simulations of ligand dissociation from a protein. The files are set up for use with GROMACS 5.1 and may be _incredibly_ outdated.

These will hopefully serve as a reference for any inspiration one should need for collective variables though! 

If you do use these files, or find them helpful, please cite the following paper:\
